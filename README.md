Project Title:
AI-Based Phishing Email Language Detector

Objective of the Project:
The main objective of this project is to develop a small AI-enabled system that can identify phishing emails by analyzing their language. The system will help users understand whether an email is genuine or potentially harmful.

Problem Statement:
In today’s digital world, phishing emails are becoming very common. These emails try to trick people into sharing sensitive information like passwords, OTPs, or bank details. Many users are unable to identify phishing emails because they often look professional and convincing. Since manual detection is not always reliable, there is a need for an intelligent system that can automatically analyze email content and detect suspicious patterns.

Proposed Methodology / Tools to be Used:
In this project, I will first collect sample phishing and legitimate email messages. Then, I will preprocess the text by cleaning and organizing the data. Using basic AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, I will build a simple classification model that can differentiate between phishing and genuine emails based on keywords, tone, and writing style.

The tools that will be used include:

Python

Basic NLP libraries such as NLTK or Scikit-learn

Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook for implementation

A simple user interface will be created where a user can paste an email message and receive a result indicating whether it is Safe or Suspicious.

Expected Outcome:
The expected outcome of this project is a working prototype that can analyze email text and provide a prediction about its authenticity. This system will increase awareness about phishing attacks and help users make safer decisions while handling emails.
